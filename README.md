This repository contains work on our first team project by Ugwuanyi Afam and Sikiru Jimoh. This repository contains  source code for our  own printf function named "_printf".
_Printf is a very versatile function. It can print almost anything, sorry it can print everything that we give to it. it can be used to print a string, an integer, a float, a char, a double, and just about any other kind of datatype that might just enter our head. In this repository, we hope to create a function that is as versatile as the printf function with the ability to print anything we pass to it. The funtion will follow the printf format, the only noticeable difference will be the underscore behind the printf function. THe following format specifiers are handled in this function:

-> %c - prints a character

-> %d - prints an integer

-> %s - prints a string

-> %f - prints a float

-> %x - prints a hexadecimal


This is the syntax for our printf function

int _printf(const char *s,...)
_it is a variadic function so as to be able to take any number of arguments we pass to it.
